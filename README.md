### Step 2: Install Dependencies

- Open your **Command Prompt** or **terminal** in the project directory (where you cloned the repo).

- Run one of the following commands to install all required packages from `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
npm i
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

- Once the installation completes without errors (you may ignore any warnings), start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- After running the above command, you'll get a **localhost** link in the terminal (usually something like `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`).

- Open that link in your browser to view the project.
